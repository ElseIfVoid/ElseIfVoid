### 🧠 About Me

I'm a self-taught developer who prefers to stay anonymous — no real names, just real code.  
I enjoy exploring ideas, building tiny tools, and learning how to make the web more interactive and alive.

- 💻 I know **Python** and **HTML**
- 🌱 Currently learning **JavaScript**
- 🛠️ Love experimenting with games, bots, and creative automation

### 🧩 What I'm Into

- Designing simple, fun projects with a twist
- Learning by building and breaking things
- Staying consistent, even when it's messy
- Creating stuff that others find useful or fun

### 🚧 Work in Progress

Right now, I’m working on:
- My first interactive JavaScript mini-projects ⚡

### 📫 Let's Keep It Simple

No links. No bios. No distractions.  
Just an anonymous dev sharing the journey through code.
